# asp.net-core-blockchain-for-ethereum-Realestate
In this project, the Realestate interact with the smart-contract through userâ€™s Ethereum account and to the API layer through a JWT Token issued in exchange of user credentials.
A smart contract is a piece of code written for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 
This can be written in Solidity and compiled to byte code. 
This byte code is put in the ledger and becomes immutable but still can be interacted with, and can have changing states.
